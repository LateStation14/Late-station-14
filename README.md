# LateStation14

**LateStation** is a custom content fork of the official [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) project. We aim to create our own gameplay experience, with original mechanics, stations, and assets — all while staying aligned with the upstream SS14 codebase.

We are currently building our own identity on top of the core SS14 platform. While much of the game is still similar to upstream, LateStation is actively developing unique systems, content, and balance changes to support our own long-term vision.

**Space Station 14** is a remake of the classic SS13, running on [RobustToolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox) — an open-source game engine written in C# and built specifically for multiplayer, tile-based simulation games like SS14.
